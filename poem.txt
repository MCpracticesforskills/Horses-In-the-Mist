Horses in the Mist and the Kitty in the Garden Chasing Dragonfly
By Morgan Coyle


Hooves churning up groomed soil.
Catch a glimpse of chocolate, dappled kisses on a muscled, glistening coat.
Steam floats from a rising, falling chest.
Sunlight blinds the arena.
Let’s go back to the barn someone said.
That sounds good to me, how about you horsey boo?
Clip clop of hooves across a cement bridge
Warm water relaxes tired muscles,
The smell of carrot fills his lungs
This is the good life, he says; you can see it in his eyes.
He’s content, licking his lips,
Swaggering across the sunny yard.
Soft, flaky pine-scented bedding awaits him inside a clean, airy stall
Back to your cage you go I tease
Until next time, love
The kitty hops amongst the flaxen soil.
Chasing a dragonfly, his heart flutters with playful pause.
